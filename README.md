# CUDA_exercises

These are a series of CUDA exercises based on Wen-mei W. Hwu's ECE408 at UIUC, as well as the book Programming Massively Parallel Processors.

Since I do not have access to UIUC's GPU servers, the project structure is based on Travis Thompson's CUDA Makefile template:  https://github.com/TravisWThompson1/Makefile_Example_CUDA_CPP_To_Executable 

To run:
```
make
./run_test data/0/input0.raw data/0/input1.raw data/0/output.raw
```
